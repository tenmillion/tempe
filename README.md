Simulation of cooling of mammalian epileptic cortex
Implemented by Y Yamamura
6 Oct 2013 - (Ongoing)

This is a simulation of a somewhat simplified neuronal network with HH-type conductances, roughly based on Bush et al. 1999's model of cortical epileptic discharges after trauma.
Right now I've taken away the parts that were supposed to model the brain's epileptogenic responses to trauma (changes in membrane resistance, cell size, increase in excitatory connections etc.) and am instead trying to model a pharmacological animal model of epilepsy where penicillin or bicuculline induces disinhibition.
My ultimate aim is to model how cooling the cortex can stop an epileptic seizure. I am guessing that the cooling-induced changes in ion channel and synaptic dynamics are the principal causes, but I am not sure which is (more) responsible, and whether other temperature-induced changes must be taken into account.
